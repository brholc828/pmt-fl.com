Dear
 
I am a professor at the Federal University of Pelotas and head of the Laboratory of Control Systems (http://lattes.cnpq.br/3521561406196708) which currently has a group of 10 students of Control Engineering and Automation and Electronic Engineering (courses started in 2010/02).
 
It would be very important if we could receive samples related to process control. Development platforms, evolution boards that can be used as teaching tools for linear systems, feedback systems, multivariable control.

Today, the goal is to develop, explore and investigate the construction of a digital microscope for use in the laboratory.

Certainly'd have a considerable gain knowledge.
 
These are the sites of the courses.
