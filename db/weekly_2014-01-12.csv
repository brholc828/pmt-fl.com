"Rungun Nathan","","610 396 6170","rungun.nathan@psu.edu","Distance Measurement","Hi
I came across your chip in the TDC series and found your applications for distance measurement very interesting.  I am interested in using this as part of a research project for "in class experiments" that I am designing.  I want to measure distance under a foot and am interested in  higher accuracy while keeping the cost really low.  This combined with some of the other hardware will be bought by each student for in class experiment.  The market will be huge, but I am currently working on a grant proposal that will fund the initial proof of concept development.  I would like to talk to someone in the company who can make business decisions.  Wait to hear from you

thanks

Truly looking for more along the lines of sample quantities.  We are developing a new technology for healthcare and the PCap01 meets the design requirements.  Let me know what you guys can do for me.

Thanks,
