"Everette Harris","","609-394-3102 ext 203","eharris@headwaters.com","ultrasonic density detection","HTI is developing a basic design for a pilot plant which will be build this year in South Korea. Normally we would recommend the use of nuclear density gauges to monitor the catalyst bed level inside the chemical reactor. This reactor will be 5-inch sched 160 pipe with up to 5 inches of inches all around the outside of the pipe and electrical resistance windings on the outside as well. Inside the pipe, the lower section of the reactor will be 3 phase, alumina catalyst, process liquid and vapor. The upper section of the reactor will only have 2 phase liquid and vapor. The objective is to use the detector to find the top of the catalyst bed and use that information to control the reactor recirculation pump. We would like to know if you have a non-nuclear gauge device that can monitor the catalyst bed height. The density within the catalyst bed will be in the 700 to 1100 kg/m3 range while above it the density will be in the 400 to 600 range and less than 300 during an upset if it is vapou","2015-01-13","","1"
