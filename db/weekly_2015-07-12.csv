"Stefan Schwartz","Phenospex B.V.","+31457111692","s.schwartz@phenospex.com","DLC-TYPE 1 and DLC-TYPE 2","Hi, we are interested in your temperature compensated load cells. We use load cells in various projects for plant science and always have difficulties with temperature so your product might be of interest for us.

would it be possible to get some bulk prices for different quantities? e.g. 10 Cells, 100 cells, 1000 cells.

What's your typical delivery time for larger quantities?

Regards,
Stefan","2015-07-10","","2"

I would like to ask you whether the PCap02 would be suitable for our application.
Basically we would like to measure Capacitances with a bandwidth of up to 20kHz for two scenarios: 
a) Single capacitance: Base capacitance 0.8 pF with resolution 0,4 fF and range 1pF
b) Differential capacitance: 0,2 fF resolution and range 1pF

Thank you very much in advance for your feedback
