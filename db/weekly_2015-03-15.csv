"George Thomas","Innovative Devices Inc.","2162558848","gthomas@mycestro.com","TDC-GP22","Hi,

I am interested in incorporating RF time-of-flight capability into my product (the Mycestro, a wearable mouse), and I'm looking at the TDC-GP22 because I need something with a small footprint. I would like to start with either some samples, or maybe a development kit. If everything looks good, we will be ordering quantities from 500 to 5000, more than once a year. I may still be interested in some samples, even if you can't meet those volumes, but if you can, what is the typical lead time on these chips?

Thank you,

George Thomas
