"Qiang Zhou","","","betterchou@gmail.com","Can we install the AM-GPX (TDC-GPX Evalu","Hi Miss or Sir,

I am Qiang Zhou from University of Calgary Canada. Here I am writing to you to ask some questions about the  AM-GPX (TDC-GPX Evaluation System).

We have a TDC-GPX Evaluation System in our lab, and it was working with a computer with WIN XP system. But, recently it does not work (some damage happens to the WIN XP system), we are trying to repair it with the software provided on the website http://www.pmt-fl.com/pmt-downloads.php#tdc. And we saw some software for WIN 7 is provided on this website. Does it mean that we can use the AM-GPX (TDC-GPX Evaluation System) in WIN 7 computer?

Cheers,
Qiang Zhou","2015-06-08","","1"
