"Michelle Pyle","","3619469819","michellepyle@aggiemail.usu.edu","Question about TDC Spec","Hello; I am not very familiar with TDCs, and noticed the "edge-to-edge" timing on the TDC-GP1. Is this spec specifying how close together the incoming hits can be (minimum time before the next hit can be detected)?

Thanks!","2015-09-29","","1"
