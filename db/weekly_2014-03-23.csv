"Greg Rowe","","","rowe@ll.mit.edu","Operating temp range on the GP21","I note in your specsheet that the low end of the operating temp range is -40C (storage to -55C).  We have an application where the electronics may cold soak at -65C before turn-on, then gradually warm up to -30C and operate for extended periods of time at -30C.  I was wondering if there was a reason that the part will fail to operate colder than -40C, or will it just no longer meet spec?   Thanks in advance.","2014-03-21","","1"
