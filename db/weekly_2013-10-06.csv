I am a student working on a project and have purchased a few of the Acam GP22 TDCs.  I am currently in the process of writing code and had a question about the logic of the generic example code provided in one of the GP22 documents:

// Result_UP, TOF in µs
    // RES_0 to RES_2 to be displayed only for evaluation purposes
    // RES_3 will be used for e.g. flow calculation
    Result_0_up = gp22_read_n_bytes(Bus_Type,4,0xB0,0x00,16)/CLKHS_freq_cal;
    Result_1_up = gp22_read_n_bytes(Bus_Type,4,0xB0,0x01,16)/CLKHS_freq_cal;
    Result_2_up = gp22_read_n_bytes(Bus_Type,4,0xB0,0x02,16)/CLKHS_freq_cal;
    average_Result_up = gp22_read_n_bytes(Bus_Type,4,0xB0,0x03,16)/CLKHS_freq_cal;

    gp22_send_1byte(Bus_Type, Init);

    // Wait for INT Slot_x, DOWNSTREAM
    if (Bus_Type==SPI1) while (GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(GPIOD, GPIO_Pin_4)==1); 
    if (Bus_Type==SPI2) while (GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(GPIOE, GPIO_Pin_11)==1);
