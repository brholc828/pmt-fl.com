Could you please provide a quote and lead time for one of these controllers. We already have an appropriate sm sensor. The application will be fairly typical, with speeds not exceeding 60,000 rpm with 16 vanes. Output in the form of a pulse would be best, although analogue is also possible.

Regards,

Thomas","2015-01-21","","2"
