My name is Zac Harford, and I’m with Cincinnati Test Systems. I am currently working on a machine which may use one of your PICOTURN-2G sensors, and needs to be CE certified. To ensure compliance I will need the CE Declaration of Conformity for the sensor.

Can you provide me  with the necessary documentation?

Thanks,

How much would be oneTDC-GP2?  We are building a prototype of a device, that why we require just one at this point.  Also, in case, that it is working well for our needs, how much would it be to purchase more than one from you, please?

I am using measurement mode 1. I am testing the TDC by applying a square wave pulse with a period of 100ns. Every time I make a measurement it just gives me 0xFFFFFFFF which means that it timed out. Can you please help me figure out why it keeps timing out? My configuration registers are:

"Daniel","","33325715866","laurent.daniel@utt.fr","TDC for ultrasonic time of flight measur","Hi,

We are a university lab, doing measurment with US using precise time of flight.

Our  application at the moment is done with ultra-sonic generators  and oscilloscopes and we do  intend to simplify  our  measurment chain.

We would be interested in using your TDC and eventually also by  your knowledge in chaining ultra-sonic drivers with TDC directly  into one device.

Ar first sight we would be glad to get documentation on your  TDC devices especially focused on time of flight measurment.

If I can get it from you, than how, and how much?
I'd need one only to build a prototype.

"Rungun Nathan","","610 396 6170","rungun.nathan@psu.edu","Distance Measurement","Hi
I came across your chip in the TDC series and found your applications for distance measurement very interesting.  I am interested in using this as part of a research project for "in class experiments" that I am designing.  I want to measure distance under a foot and am interested in  higher accuracy while keeping the cost really low.  This combined with some of the other hardware will be bought by each student for in class experiment.  The market will be huge, but I am currently working on a grant proposal that will fund the initial proof of concept development.  I would like to talk to someone in the company who can make business decisions.  Wait to hear from you

"Anatoly Babitsyn","","","anatol911@mail.ru","technicals questions TDC-GP22","Dear Mr

I am the developer of various electronic measuring systems for industrial applications, in particular for PET plastic injection molding machines. 
I represent a company OLICORP. 
I'm looking for a simple solution to build a compact, low consumption of water flow meter at this stage. I chose one of the solutions - it is to apply your chip: TDC-GP22. So I have a few technicals questions on the use of this chip:
1) I use ultrasonic transducers with resonance frequency 975KHz. Chip TDC-GP22 generates  outputs FIRE_UP and FIRE_DOWN frequency 1MHz. - Can I use a resonator 3.9MHz instead 4.0MHz for a high-speed reference oscillator? It will not affect of the received signal processing times?
2) Can I apply for an external signal frequency 3.9MHz to pin1 XIN  generated by the microcontroller?
