I am the developer of various electronic measuring systems for industrial applications, in particular for PET plastic injection molding machines. 
I represent a company OLICORP. 
I'm looking for a simple solution to build a compact, low consumption of water flow meter at this stage. I chose one of the solutions - it is to apply your chip: TDC-GP22. So I have a few technicals questions on the use of this chip:
1) I use ultrasonic transducers with resonance frequency 975KHz. Chip TDC-GP22 generates  outputs FIRE_UP and FIRE_DOWN frequency 1MHz. - Can I use a resonator 3.9MHz instead 4.0MHz for a high-speed reference oscillator? It will not affect of the received signal processing times?
2) Can I apply for an external signal frequency 3.9MHz to pin1 XIN  generated by the microcontroller?
