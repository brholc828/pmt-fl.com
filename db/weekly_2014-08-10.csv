"Jim Carter","","503-352-7626","jcarter@leupold.com","Acam devices for Laser Rangefinder","Jim Coone (sorry about the spelling) contacted us regarding the Acam for Laser Rangefinders - for Leopold & Stevens.  Both Shiela Lumley and Don Cramer no longer work for our company.  Supposedly, we had purchased/received a demo/reference design, but I have no idea where this would be.  I was interested in the acam as I know another company that builds laser rangefinders uses this method.  I would be interested in getting more information.  Thanks","2014-08-07","","1"
