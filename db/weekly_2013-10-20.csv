We are in the process of designing a laser rangefinder for experimentation at Portland State University. Would it be possible to get a few samples of this chip?

Also, I am interested in the cost of this chip, as well as it's evaluation kit.

Thanks for your help,

I am more experienced in the design of analogue than digital circuitry and would appreciate any help that you can give me. An indication of the price for a small number e.g of PCAP01 would be useful.","2013-10-16","","1"
