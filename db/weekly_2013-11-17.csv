"Zac Harford","","","zharford@cincinnati-test.com","CE Declaration of Conformity","Hello,

My name is Zac Harford, and I’m with Cincinnati Test Systems. I am currently working on a machine which may use one of your PICOTURN-2G sensors, and needs to be CE certified. To ensure compliance I will need the CE Declaration of Conformity for the sensor.

Can you provide me  with the necessary documentation?

Thanks,

We are a Spanish company looking for CDC solutions to measure accurately capacitive sensors arount 0-20nF with 0,01 nF resolution and SPI interface.

As we are very interested in your PCAP products, could you please give us a quote (or redirect us to distributors) for evaluating them. Could we just have a quote for the plug-in module?.

Thanks ins advance
