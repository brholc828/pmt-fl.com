We are studing different technical solution to make a length measure. The measurement of time of flight could be one. This is the reason of my message.

I could see that many of your product could answer our problem. In fact, all TDC that could make a measure between two channel with a resolution better than 100ps is intressting. A SPI link could be an advantage.

Could you send me a commercial offer for 10 of your cheapest chip please? and an other for 1000 (if this solution is validated)
