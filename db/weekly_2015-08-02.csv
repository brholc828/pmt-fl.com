"Ms.C. Guillermo Daniel Jimenez","","","djimenez@cicese.edu.mx","Regarding the TDC-GPX evaluation boards","Dear vendor,

Our research group is currently evaluating the acquisition of a high performance TDC for use with SPCMs in photon pair experiments. The TDC-GPX  has excellent qualities that make it a top candidate at the moment; however, it seems that the evaluation boards available due to the upcoming introduction of the TDC-GPX2, although there have been no updates for about a year in this topic.

Please provide information regarding pricing and availability of the evaluation boards for either the TDC-GPX or the TDC-GPX2. Due to our institutional budget time-frame, the device must be bought before the end of October, thus we would very much appreciate your prompt response.

Sincerely,
