"Ken Wells","","","ken.r.wells@gmail.com","Need help selecting a part","Hello,

I am looking into making a low cost laser range finder for consumer application.  it will be used by people who play "Airsoft," a game of running around and shooting at each other with plastic BB pellets.

Some friends and I are interested in making a targeting computer for people who play this game and I am trying to gather information to see how feasible our idea is.  I need a low cost, low power and small size laser range finder that is only accurate to about 2 meters.  I understand your parts exceed this resolution.

I am initially interested in purchasing only a few parts, as well as a dev kit, with the hope of expanding and purchasing 1000's of parts if the product is successful.  I am looking for an active part (not one facing end-of-life), that can control the firing of a laser and measuring the time of reflection.  Simplicity and low cost and low power are my main concerns.

Thank you for any help.
